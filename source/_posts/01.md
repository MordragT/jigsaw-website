Hey there,
finally i got the time to make what i wanted for a long time,
a blog where i can write about the stuff i am learning in my <mark>computer science</mark> degree course.
I will write all my posts in english but i am no native speaker so please dont expect it
to be perfect.
At the moment i have much to-do because of upcoming exams but after that i will start my
blog with a introduction to a programming language. I am still deciding whether it will be
<mark>C++, Python or Java</mark>.  
After that i definitly also want to make tutorials on <mark>linux</mark> and some <mark>gaming</mark> related stuff
might also come.  
If i really have the freetime, i will make <mark>videos</mark> based on the blog posts i wrote on youtube,
but till then i must buy a new microphone.  
So thats it, stay tuned...
